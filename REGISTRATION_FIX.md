# Registration Fix Documentation

## Issue
The registration form was throwing an error: "Register function is undefined on authForSubmit!" because the `RegisterForm` component was trying to call a `register()` function that didn't exist in the updated AuthContext.

## Root Cause
When the authentication system was migrated from mock authentication to real Supabase authentication, the AuthContext was updated to use `signUp()` instead of `register()`, but the `RegisterForm` component wasn't updated accordingly.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated RegisterForm Component (`components/auth/RegisterForm.tsx`)
**Before:**
```typescript
// Was trying to call authForSubmit.register(userData)
const { success, error: registrationError, user } = await authForSubmit.register(userData);
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Now calls signUp with correct parameters
const { signUp } = auth;
const { error: registrationError } = await signUp(email, password, metadata);
```

### 2. Enhanced AuthContext SignUp Function (`contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
**Before:**
```typescript
// Limited metadata acceptance
signUp: (email: string, password: string, metadata: { full_name: string; role: 'landlord' | 'renter' })
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Accepts comprehensive metadata
signUp: (email: string, password: string, metadata: any)
```

### 3. Updated Type Definitions (`types/auth.ts`)
Added comprehensive metadata interface:
```typescript
export interface SignUpMetadata {
  full_name: string;
  role: 'landlord' | 'renter';
  phone?: string;
  fullNameAr?: string;
  // Landlord specific fields
  companyName?: string;
  licenseNumber?: string;
  bankAccountDetails?: string;
  propertyAddress?: string;
  // Renter specific fields
  preferredLocationEn?: string;
  preferredLocationAr?: string;
  budget?: number;
  desiredMoveInDate?: string;
}
```

### 4. Parameter Mapping Fix
The RegisterForm now properly maps all form fields into a metadata object that matches what the AuthContext expects:

```typescript
const metadata = {
  full_name: fullName,
  role: role,
  fullNameAr: fullNameAr,
  phone: phoneNumber,
  ...(role === 'landlord' && {
    companyName,
    licenseNumber,
    bankAccountDetails,
    propertyAddress,
  }),
  ...(role === 'renter' && {
    preferredLocationEn,
    preferredLocationAr,
    budget: budget ? parseFloat(budget) : undefined,
    desiredMoveInDate,
  }),
};
```

## Features Now Working

✅ **User Registration**: Users can now register successfully with both landlord and renter roles
✅ **Role-Specific Data**: Additional fields for landlords and renters are captured
✅ **Profile Creation**: User profiles are automatically created in the `profiles` table
✅ **Metadata Storage**: All form data is stored in Supabase auth user metadata
✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error messages are displayed for registration failures
✅ **Navigation**: Users are redirected to appropriate screens based on their role

## Testing Registration

1. **Landlord Registration**: Fill out landlord-specific fields (company name, license, bank details)
2. **Renter Registration**: Fill out renter-specific fields (preferred location, budget)
3. **Validation**: All required fields must be filled and passwords must match
4. **Success Flow**: Upon successful registration, users are redirected to role-appropriate screens

## Database Impact

The fix ensures that:
- Basic profile data (full_name, role, email, phone) is stored in the `profiles` table
- Extended metadata is stored in Supabase auth user metadata
- Profile creation happens automatically during registration
- All data is properly linked to the authenticated user

## Security Considerations

- Email addresses are normalized (lowercase, trimmed)
- Passwords are handled securely by Supabase
- All metadata is stored securely in Supabase auth system
- Profile creation follows Row Level Security (RLS) policies

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing:
- Email verification flow
- Profile completion wizard for missing data
- Advanced validation for role-specific fields
- Image upload for profile pictures
- Location autocomplete for address fields

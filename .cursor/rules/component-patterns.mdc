# Component Patterns and Structure

## Navigation Components
The main navigation component is [BottomNavBar.tsx](mdc:components/BottomNavBar.tsx), which handles both landlord and renter navigation. It accepts a `userType` prop to determine which navigation tabs to display:

```typescript
<BottomNavBar userType="landlord" /> // For landlord view
<BottomNavBar userType="renter" />   // For renter view
```

## Text Components
There are two main text components with distinct purposes:

1. [ThemedText.tsx](mdc:components/ThemedText.tsx) - Theme-aware text component that:
   - Inherits theme colors from the app's color scheme
   - Supports text variants (default, heading, subheading, caption)
   - Should be used when theme consistency is required

2. Text.tsx - Base text component with variant support
   - Used for non-themed text elements
   - Provides consistent typography across the app
   - Supports the same variants as ThemedText

## Component Guidelines
1. Use the unified BottomNavBar component for navigation, specifying the appropriate userType
2. Use ThemedText when the text needs to respond to theme changes
3. Keep component styles consistent by using the established color scheme and typography patterns
4. Follow the variant pattern for components that need different visual styles
